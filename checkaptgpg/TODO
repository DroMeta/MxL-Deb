TODO list for checkaptgpg
-------------------------

Translations (and lack thereof)
  There is currently no attempt to translate checkaptgpg into anything 
  other than English. Translating the .desktop menu entry should be easy 
  to do. But I've no idea how to translate a script.

Manpage (and lack thereof)
  There is currently no manpage for checkaptgpg. There is also no help 
  produced by the script if something goes wrong or if --help is 
  provided as a switch.

Debian directory not clean
  The debian directory has not been cleared of detritus yet.
