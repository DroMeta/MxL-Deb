 - Don't intend to keep updating this CHANGELOG, see debian/changelog for
   changes.

2013 May 25
 - Adjusted keyserver list to minimize timeouts from a formerly fast server.
 - Removed the segment which filtered out of the unsigned
   MEPIS Community Repositories as the ones for MEPIS 12 are signed.

2009 Aug 4
 - Added a configuration file - /etc/checkaptgpg.conf
   - CRONJOB_ENABLED - If this is not set to yes, then the default 
       weekly cronjob will not run.
   - KEYSERVER - specifies the keyserver to use to download GPG keys 
       from.
 - Added two command line options:
   --wait-at-end : causes the program to sleep for 10 seconds at the end 
       before terminating. It is intended to be used when called from 
       the menu system.
   --cronjob : tells the program that it is being run from a cronjob. It 
       will parse the contents of /etc/checkaptgpg.conf and only 
       continue to run if CRONJOB_ENABLED=yes.

2009 Aug 3
 - Added colourisation when using BASH. DASH seems to be incapable of 
   supporting colour. BASH is detected by looking for the $BASH 
   environment variable.
