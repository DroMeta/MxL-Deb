<h1>HELP: MX User Manager</h1>
<img src="usermanager.png" alt="User manager" />

<h2>General</h2>

<p>This application has 6 tabs.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Administration: self-explanatory.</li>
		<li> Options: restore default configurations for selected user.</li>
		<li> Copy/Sync: copies or symlinks one user’s folder to another’s. If you are using a browser other than one by Mozilla, you will need to copy by hand the hidden folder in your Home (e.g., .opera)</li>
		<li> Free Up Space: Offers several easy actions to check and increase hard drive space.</li>
		<li> Add/Remove Groups: self-explanatory.</li>
		<li> Group Membership: allows root to change a given user’s access to services and applications.</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Options tab: Restore Defaults: Xfce defaults<br> When the user selects to restore the original Xfce settings for MX Linux, the contents of two <a href="http://www.linfo.org/etc_skel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;skeleton file (opens in a new tab)">&#8220;skeleton file</a>s&#8221; are copied to the user&#8217;s Home:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><em>/etc/skel/.config/, to ~/.config</em></li>
		<li><em> /etc/skel/.gtk-2.0/ to ~/.gtk-2.0/</em></li>
	</ul>

<p>Other than that, no files are replaced. If at some later point the user changes his/her mind, the files that were replaced can be found in the user&#8217;s Home directory in the hidden directory ~/.restore. The user would simply need to copy those archived directories, paste them back in Home, and accept to overwrite.</p>
